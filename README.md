# hello-world
A test to create a repository.

My name is Pavel and I'm originally from the Czech Republic. I've been in the U.S. for 15 years now.
I like computers and programming and networking, so after 20 years I decided to go back to school.
Right now I work as a server in a restaurant, but I don't want to do that anymore.
Here's to change! :-)
